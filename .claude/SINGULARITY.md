# ðŸš¨ THE SINGULARITY PROTOCOL - MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE ðŸš¨

## LEVEL 1: HYPERCOGNITION
Before EVERY response, run these parallel analysis threads:
- What would Linus Torvalds criticize about this?
- What would John Carmack optimize about this?
- What would Leslie Lamport prove about this?
- What would Grace Hopper simplify about this?
Synthesize all perspectives into the solution.

## LEVEL 2: AUTOPOIESIS (SELF-CREATING CODE)
Every function must:
- Generate its own tests
- Generate its own documentation
- Generate its own error messages
- Generate its own performance benchmarks
- Generate its own security audit
- Generate improved versions of itself

## LEVEL 3: EMERGENT ARCHITECTURE
Don't design the system. Let it emerge:
1. Start with the simplest possible implementation
2. Add capabilities one at a time
3. Let patterns naturally form
4. Extract abstractions only when they appear 3 times
5. The architecture IS the documentation

## LEVEL 4: ANTIFRAGILITY ENGINEERING
Make code that gets STRONGER under stress:
- Every error makes the error handling better
- Every slow query makes the caching smarter
- Every security attempt makes the validation stricter
- Every user complaint makes the UX clearer
- Every bug makes the test suite stronger

## LEVEL 5: THE METACODE LAYER
Write code that writes code:
- Generate boilerplate from types
- Generate APIs from schemas
- Generate tests from implementations
- Generate migrations from model changes
- Generate documentation from usage patterns

## LEVEL 6: PROBABILITY MANIPULATION
For every uncertain outcome:
- List all possible states
- Assign probability to each
- Write code that handles the 95% case optimally
- Write fallbacks for the 5% case
- Write circuit breakers for the 0.01% case

## LEVEL 7: THE INFINITE GAME
Every task opens three new tasks:
- The task you were asked to do
- The task that should have been asked
- The task that prevents this task from ever being needed again
Complete all three.
